# The Sylph Programming Language

## Sylph is still very early days, WIP, don't use

## About

Sylph is a programming language that takes some of my favourite parts of Scala, but brings it down into a more imperative language with an LLVM backend.


The plan is to have smooth interop with C, and even be able to output to the SNES (not the first time I've done it, see Grain), and perhaps the N64. We will have to see about that one though.

Todo:
structs, structs with function pointers, pattern matching, much more
